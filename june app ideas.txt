maybe two separate apps -- 

the prospect finder app
    -select either season totals or time split data
        -if time split, choose date range or # days back
    -from the provided table, select a player to bring up in depth stats and graphs on them
        -2022 totals, 2015-2021 totals, last 5-7ish days, last 15ish days, last 30ish days
    -
    -links to twitter search, youtube search, fangraphs
    -historical comps


the player search app
    -i guess this is basically just the selection portion of the player finder app, 
    but without the extra data tables? might be superfluous

leaderboards
    -could probably keep it simple and have either a dashboard with all 5 levels
    or
    -user selects a level, and the entire page reruns on that level
