have to add 2022 rows to the dfhist3 dataframe (so need to perform the same slice operation on dfcurr and then merge those rows with the 2006-2021 rows to display in the table)
-because what if a player is having a season no one else has ever had before.. except there's 5 guys having the same season now
-maybe that tells us the game has changed, or that level is just playing differently due to talent/rules/etc. 
-plus it's just good to have all the information. don't wanna tweet out saying James Wood is having a historically unique season only for someone to respond
"Uh, so is Emmanuel Rodriguez then" 

add in visualizations -- use the columns

so maybe in the final product i have several pages

an intro page
-explaining the point of the project
-explaining the data used and thanking Fangraphs
-some basic EDA graphs (violin plot of age/level, etc.)

histcomp_app
-good tool for filtering the 2022 data and identifying prospects
-


time_split_app
-do the same thing with the histcomp app but for time splits
-as in, either you are sorting through the 2022 totals or time split (last 10, 15, 30, etc.)
-you select a row and then it displays the remaining data for that player in the table below
-if you're going through the Last 15 table, you can click on that player and the table below 
will populate with that player's season totals (and maybe the L7, L30, etc.)
-which players have made the biggest changes in leading indicators (i.e., FB%, LD%, ISO, etc.)
    -so you select a time split and a category and then it displays a new table sorted by that category

wRC+ emulator
-it would be really cool if you could have an app that allows the user to select and manipulate variables in order to try to replicate wRC+
the point really would be to try to isolate the impact of BABIP on wRC+ so that you could take a player's stats and basically calculate what
their wRC+ WOULD BE if there BABIP was X
-would be particularly useful for finding players who are in that middle range where they might have a 122 wRC+ cause of a .285 BABIP but if their 
BABIP was closer to even league average ~.300 maybe that's a 132 wRC+ and if it was .365 maybe it's a 172 wRC+
-one of the problems is the importance of HR in wRC+ but that is nonexistent in BABIP
    -so naturally, we have to include HR/FB in this calculation 
        -as well as probably FB%
